# Strings

- split
- word_count

`trim(string, characters=" \t\n\r")`
  - create a new string from string such that the specified characters are removed from the beginning and ends of string
  - e.g. `trim("  hello ") = "hello"`

`parse_int`
  - create a number from a string representing that number
  - e.g. `parse_int("1234") = 1234`
  - What about negative numbers?

- repeat
- index_of
- includes
- replace (non-regex)
- dc (reverse-polish)
